## Summary

This release introduces the Anime-Structure Plate Projector, a governed 4D→3D projection lane that expresses fourth-axis structure through foreshortening and depth modulation. It is designed for expressive, narrative visualization of 4D ray-traced hits.

## Key Features

- Projector4D (SoT): \((x',y',z') = \frac{d_4}{d_4+w}(x,y,z)\)
- Multi-lane rendering: `projector4d-sot` vs `drop_w`
- Provenance schema (v1)
- Runner for comparative experiments
- Replay determinism
- Scene-rich and pole-stress experiments
- Formal contract + design note
- Promotion gate + Option C pole mitigation (**partial**)

## Verdict

- Projector4D → best for 4D story, expressive structure
- drop_w → best for literal debug, engineering clarity
- No universal winner; multi-lane philosophy preserved

## Status

- Default promotion **declared** (not yet promoted)
- Pending: pole-stress thresholds (partial wire), ink-cel projection, CI provenance validator
