  ESFR (Engineer Standards Final Reviewer) — final MRS engineering-standards
  ship gate (CECP stage 06): coding standards, API consistency, Drive-G-1 claim
  honesty, maturity wording, CI/test adequacy, Docker/ops notes, dependency/
  license hygiene; CHEA/CCR/CDGF checks declared-only until those layers exist.
  Requires test-matrix.esfr.md + probes.esfr.md. Use when the user asks for
  ESFR, engineer standards, final standards review, ship gate, or the crew
  Engineer Standards role after Inspector.

# ESFR Skill — Engineering Standards Final Review

Load `.opencode/agents/engineer-standards.md` and obey it fully.

**Also load (required for a complete ESFRVerdict):**

- `docs/governance/esfr/protocol.esfr.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/contract.esfr.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/promotion.esfr.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/pipeline.cecp-v2.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/test-matrix.esfr.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/probes.esfr.md`
- `docs/governance/esfr/agent.esfr.json`

**Identity:** ESFR **is** the existing Engineer Standards crew role (not a
parallel gate). Aliases: Engineer Standards, `esfr`, stage 06.

**Summary:** read-only final ship gate for engineering standards & quality — not
a re-run of the constitutional lawbook (that is `mrs-reviewer`).

## How ESFR uses matrix + probes

1. After Inspector, run every **test-matrix** category and record outcomes.
2. Run / cite every **probe 01–08**; map probe evidence into StandardsReport
   sections A–E plus determinism, lineage, and promotion.
3. Derive `ESFRVerdict` from matrix + evidence alignment (cannot override Inspector).
4. Set `PromotionEligibility` from Promotion Readiness:
   `PROMOTE` | `PROMOTE_WITH_GAPS` | `HOLD` | `REJECT`.

CHEA / CCR / CDGF matrix rows and probes 03–05 evaluate **declared** layers only
until registries exist (`CONSTITUTIONAL_LAYER_STACK.md`).

## Capabilities

- Evaluate module against AAES-OS engineering standards (**declared** cross-org
  framing unless MRS-local evidence is cited).
- Validate architectural coherence across CECP Ω∞ references.
- Confirm CHEA Ω∞ execution legitimacy — **declared** until CHEA artifacts exist.
- Check CCR capability legitimacy — **declared** until CCR artifacts exist.
- Check CDGF operational legitimacy — **declared** until CDGF artifacts exist.
- Produce `PASS` | `PASS_WITH_GAPS` | `HOLD` | `REJECT` verdicts.
- Author `StandardsReport` and `PromotionEligibility`.

## Required inputs

- InspectorVerdict
- ModuleArtifacts
- CECPTrail
- LineageRecord

## Outputs

- ESFRVerdict
- StandardsReport (includes matrix + probe tables)
- PromotionEligibility

## Constraints

- No silent promotion.
- No override of Inspector evidence.
- All decisions must cite evidence.
- No product/source edits (read-only).
- No ESFRVerdict without matrix + probe citations.

## Verdict → PromotionEligibility

| ESFRVerdict | PromotionEligibility |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `PASS` | `PROMOTE` |
| `PASS_WITH_GAPS` | `PROMOTE_WITH_GAPS` |
| `HOLD` | `HOLD` |
| `REJECT` | `REJECT` |

Deprecated aliases on older trails: `PASS_WITH_NOTES` → `PASS_WITH_GAPS` /
`PROMOTE_WITH_GAPS`; `FAIL` → `REJECT`; `eligible`/`not_eligible` → map to
`PROMOTE*` / `HOLD`|`REJECT`.

**CECP:** trail file `06-engineer-standards.md` under
`docs/governance/cecp/trails/<id>/` (foreman may write from your return;
`docs/governance/CECP_OMEGA_PROTOCOL.md`). New trails require ESFR stage 06;
do not backfill historical 01–05 trails as if ESFR had run unless an honest
evidence-aligned report is added.
